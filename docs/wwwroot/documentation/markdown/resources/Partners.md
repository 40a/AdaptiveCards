# Partners 
Adaptive cards are only useful if they provide benefit to a broad set of developers.  We will
develop adaptive cards in cooperation with communities and companies which share the vision 
of a common eco-system for the exchange of UI cards.

## Communities

### Botness
Bots are very aligned with the target community, and so we will be working with the Botness community to further develop the ideas.

## Companies

### Microsoft

#### Windows
Windows will be using adaptive cards for Live Tiles, Notifications, Notification Hubs and other future surfaces where it
makes sense to open up a place for 3rd party developers to show content to a user.

#### Bot Framework
The bot framework supports Adaptive cards across most of our channels. 
* Emulator, DirectLine, WebChat - full native functionality
* Facebook, SMS, GroupMe, Email, Telegram, Slack, Kik - Renders as image

#### Skype 
Coming soon

#### Teams 
Coming soon

### Kik
The Kik messaging company is the first of hopefully many partners to has started colloborating around adaptive cards.
