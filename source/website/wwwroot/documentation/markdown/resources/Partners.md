# Partners 
Adaptive cards are only useful if they benefit to a broad set of developers.  We will
develop adaptive cards in cooperation with communities and companies which share the vision 
of a common ecosystem for the exchange of UI cards.

## Communities

### Botness
Bots are aligned with the goals of target community, and so we will be working with the Botness community to develop ideas further.

## Companies

### Microsoft

* **Windows** - Windows will be using adaptive cards for Live Tiles, Notifications, Notification Hubs and other future surfaces where it
makes sense to open up a place for third-party developers to show content to a user.

* **Bot Framework** - The bot framework supports Adaptive cards across most channels. 
    * Emulator, DirectLine, WebChat - full native functionality
    * Facebook, SMS, GroupMe, Email, Telegram, Slack, Kik - Renders as image

* **Skype** - Coming soon

* **Teams** - Coming soon

### Kik
The Kik messaging company is the first of hopefully many partners to start collaborating around adaptive cards.
